Problem : - Queries with Bags

There are 'N' bags and magic cards which manufactured by DSU company 
daily. Each bag and card has assigned a number between 1 to N. Initially ith card
is in the ith bag. Now manager wants to club some card together.
Manager is really busy right now he needs your help to perform this task.

You have 'Q' queries to perform.

Each query can be among 3 types :

Type-1. 1 A B
Magic card with number A and B are merge into single bag if they belong to two 
different bags.
Its independent which bag to choose, our goal is to add both 
the cards with numebr A and B in the same bags.

Type-2. 2 A B
You need to check if two magic cards with number A and B belongs to same bag 
or not.

Type-3. 3
This query use to check how many distinct bags remained till now.

Constraints: -
1 <= N,Q <= 1e5
1 <= A,B <= N (A!=B)

Substask: -
Substask-1 :- 1 <= N,Q <= 1e3 (30 pts)
Substask-2 :- Original Constraints (70 pts)


Input: -
* First line of the input contain a single integer T denoting the number of test cases.
  The description of T test cases follows.
* The first line of each test case contain two space separated integer N and Q.
* Next Q line for each test case contain 3 space integer for Type-1 and Type-2 query
  and single integer for Type-3 query as shown in problem description.


Output: -
* For Type-2 query print "YES" if both magic cards belong to same bag else 
  print "NO" without quotes.
* For Type-3 query print a single integer that denotes no of bags remained till now.
