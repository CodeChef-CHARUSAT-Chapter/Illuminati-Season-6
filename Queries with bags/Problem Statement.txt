Problem : - Queries with Bags

You have given 'N' DSU problems number '1' to 'N' initially they all are kept in 
a 'N' distinct bags each bag contain one DSU problem. Now you have few 'Q' queries
to perform.

There are 3 types of queries :

1. 1 A B
DSU Problems with number A and B are merge into single bag if they belong to different bag.

2. 2 A B
DSU problems with number, you need to check if they belong to same bag or not.

3. 3
This query use to check how many distinct bags we have.

Constraints: -
1 <= T <= 10
1 <= N,Q <= 1e5
1 <= A,B <= N (A!=B)

Substask: -
Substask-1 :- 1 <= N,Q <= 1e3 (30 pts)
Substask-2 :- Original Constraints (70 pts)


Input: -
* First line of the input contain a single integer T denoting the number of test cases.
  The description of T test cases follows.
* The first line of each test case contain two space separated integer N and Q.
* Next Q line for each test case contain 3 space integer for Type-1 and Type-2 query
  and 1 integer for Type-3 query as per the in problem description.


Output: -
* For Type-2 query print "YES" if they belong to same group else print "NO" without
  quotes.
* For Type-3 query print a single integer that denotes no of bags till now.
