Problem : - Monty Hall Paradox 2.0

You are given an 'N' number of doors such that behind one door there is a car. There 
is one magician who knows which door is having a car.

Now your task is to choose any door at random. Note that there may be a car behind your 
chosen door (door-1). Now the magician will open all the doors except two doors which you 
have already chosen (door-1) and another door (door-2) which may or may not contain a car. 

Now you have exactly two door's left. Your task is to find the probability of a car 
behind the (door-1) and similarly car behind the (door-2).

Note: - It's proven that you always write the probability in terms of P/Q.  

Constraints: -
1 <= T <= 1000
2 <= N <= 1e18

Substask: -
Substask-1 :- Original Constraints

Input: -
First line contains a single integer 'T'.
The Next T line contains an integer 'N'.

Output: -
For each test case print the probability of the
car behind the door-1 and door-2.

In terms of 4 space separated integers.
p1 q1 p2 q2

p1/q1 -> Probability of car behind the door-1
p2/q2 -> Probability of car behind the door-2

Sample Test Case: -
1
2

Output: -
1 2 1 2
